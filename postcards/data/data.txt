technology			"Hot water is typically the second largest user for residential energy in Victoria after space heating. Hot water systems can be powered from solar, gas, electricity, wood and now even heat pumps (which use the same technology as reverse cycle air conditioners). Replacing electric, gas and wood systems with more efficient water heaters or running existing electric systems from solar PV during the day can offer significant energy and/or carbon savings."	"Lighting upgrades can play a significant role in reducing energy use, particularly for non-residential uses. Highly efficient LED lights for example use approximately one-fifth the energy of a halogen downlight."	"Older appliances (e.g. televisions and fridges) and IT equipment (e.g. computers) can consume a substantial amount of power. Fortunately there has been significant progress in improving both their efficiency and the information available to consumers to assist with better product selection. Many appliances include an energy star rating which makes it easy for consumers to choose a more efficient product. Where on-site solar exists, some whitegoods can be programmed to run during the day to take advantage of solar generation (e.g. dishwashers, dryers and washing machines)."	"Heating and cooling provides buildings with controlled internal temperatures: this typically consumes by far the most energy in a building, often more than lighting and general appliances combined. Heating uses a variety of sources: electricity, gas and wood; while most residential cooling is achieved through electric air conditioning."	"Improving the 'thermal fabric' of buildings (the walls, roofs and floors) can be an effective way of limiting the heating and cooling required to keep indoor spaces comfortable. Key measures include: insulating walls, ceilings and floors, double glazing and shading windows, and draught proofing. The key measurement for residential thermal performance is heating and cooling demand, which in Australia is generally measured in a star rating of up to 10 stars (with the minimum for a new dwelling at 6 stars). The average of existing dwellings in Victoria is less than 2 Stars!"	"Solar electricity, also known as solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity, is generated by directly converting sunlight into electricity using solar panels."	"Batteries allow electricity from the grid or electricity generated on-site (solar or wind) to be stored and used either as back up, or to 'smooth out' the variable supply from renewable energy (i.e. when the sun isn't out and wind dies down). Batteries have traditionally been used 'off-grid' however declining system costs are driving their introduction to grid connected households and businesses, either as standalone devices or in combination with solar PV. Batteries can also be used at a community and distribution network level to store electricity for managing variable renewables supply, improve reliability and to reduce network upgrade requirements."	"Solar electricity, also known as solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity, is generated by converting sunlight directly into electricity. Large or ""utility"" scale solar PV uses the same technology as rooftop solar panels. Utility scale solar PV is suited to country locations with low population density but with close proximity to appropriate grid connections."	"Wind power captures the energy of the wind by turning the blades of a wind turbine, which drives a generator that in turn produces electricity. Wind power is one of the fastest growing and most cost-effective renewable energy sources, and has grown at an average rate of 16% p.a. in capacity globally over the last decade (2008-2017, Global Wind Energy Council). There are almost 100 wind farms in Australia to date."	"Energy generation from biomass uses the burning of organic matter (e.g. crop waste) to produce heat energy at all scales (e.g. firewood is a type of biomass). At large (commercial) scale biomass is burnt to produce either heat to supply district heating or to produce steam for power generation. The creation of biogas (from the breaking down of biomass) is undertaken either actively in a biodigester, or passively by capturing ‘waste’ biogas from landfill sites or from the treatment of sewage."	"Micro hydro systems are generally around 5-100kW in scale. They can provide power to a home, community or feed into the grid. Micro hydro systems work by diverting the inflow of water from a river, stream or waterfall, the intake will have a grate to protect fish and debris. It will then be tunneled to a powerhouse that has a turbine that turns a generator, creating electricity."	"Pumped-storage Hydroelectric (PSH) has been around since the 1890s and in its current reversible form since the 1930s. It has been widely deployed all around the globe and is currently experiencing a renaissance as a solution to base-load power now that coal fired generators are being shut down. PSH pumps water from a lower to a higher elevation reservoir, it stores the potential energy of the water until there is electrical demand, then discharges it through turbines which produces electricity."	"Community microgrids utilise local resources to meet local demand. They enable high local penetration and sharing of technologies such as solar, wind, hydro, storage, combined heat and power and demand response. Microgrids also reduce losses in the elec- tricity network. A Virtual Power Plant (VPP) is a similar concept that is less constrained by geography. VPPs use internet technologies to aggregate consumption and production from multiple households and businesses: this allows distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar, batteries and 'flexible' loads to participate in markets for energy generation and grid support services."	"Electric vehicles (EVs) use electric motors to drive their wheels. Electricity is either stored in batteries in the vehicle (e.g. Li-Ion batteries like in your phone), or generated by a secondary motor powered by petrol or diesel (i.e. a hybrid-electric vehicle). Battery powered EVs and 'plug-in' hybrids can be charged using (high capacity) home charging units or at public charge stations. Similar vehicle electrification trends are happening in commercial and public transport. Importantly, the replacement of vehicles with electric versions increases overall electricity demand, meaning that EVs are a way to 'switch' from fossil fuels to renewable (electricity)."	"Many renewable energy sources already exist in Australia. Achieving zero net energy for Hepburn under this option involves the purchase of energy from existing renewable sources. Renewable electricity is usually accredited through the government's GreenPower Program, it can be purchased through a purchase agreement directly with a renewable energy supplier, choosing GreenPower from an energy retailer or using an offset product such as Hepburn Wind's Community Green. Options to purchase renewable bottled gas (e.g. biogas) and sustainably sourced wood are also possible."	"Concentrated solar thermal (CST) technology uses the heat of the sun rather than light, to generate electricity. It uses lenses and reflectors to concentrate sunlight, which then heats water, oil (or another fluid) to produce steam to drive a turbine that produces electricity. CST plants are usually paired with storage technology (e.g. molten salt) which stores heat to allow electricity to be generated when sunlight is not available."
opportunity			"More than 50% of households in Hepburn Shire have electric storage hot water systems, and a further 30% run from gas or wood. These are a very inefficient way of heating hot water and a large contributor to household energy use. Powering the electric systems from solar PV or replacing any of these with a heat pump hot water unit offers significant savings. Saving from heat pump: 70-80% less energy Total household saving: 18%"	Lighting makes up around 10% of Australia's energy consumption. The relatively recent use of halogen downlights in some households means that the proportion of energy used for lighting in these homes is even higher. 50% of all lamps are incandescent or halogen types which are obvious targets for replacement. Replacing halogen with high quality efficient LED alternatives can save 80% of the energy used in lighting. Potential energy saving from replacing halogen with LED: - Household energy: 7% of total electricity - Commercial lighting: 30% of total electricity	"Older electrical appliances can account for the largest proportion of household consumption (up to 35%). Older appliances (such as fridges) generally draw higher operating and standby power and are particularly good targets for upgrades. Measures such as Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) and Energy Labelling, help to guide improvement in energy efficient appliances. Best available appliances compared to average: 10% saving in total energy MEPS program impact (over ten years): 60-80% less energy Electricity consumption feedback/monitoring: 4 to 12% saving"	"Energy used for space heating throughout most of Victoria, and Hepburn specifically, is high. Of total heating/cooling energy, often somewhere between 80-90% is typically associated with heating. The availability of timber means a high proportion of space heating in Hepburn uses wood (58% of households) with an average 3.5 tonnes burnt annually per home. Many homes will have reverse cycle air conditioning however the use of these for heating is often quite low. The best options for space heating are efficient pelletised wood heaters or reverse cycle (heat pump) air-conditioners. Heating | replace panel heater or old gas heater with reverse cycle AC: 80% of heating energy Cooling | replacing an old AC unit: 50% of cooling energy"	"Most houses built before the year 2000 have limited or no insulation. Houses without insulation have poor thermal performance. Draughts and large glazed areas are also factors in poor thermal performance. An average house without insulation can be improved by 2 to 3 stars with insulation and some other basic efficiency measures. This equates to a 50% energy saving for space conditioning. Potential energy savings of upgrades a base (1.4 star) home: + Roof insulation to R4 (3.5 star): 50% energy saving + Wall and subfloor insulation (5.5 star): 70% energy saving + Draught proofing, shading and double glazing (7 star): 80% energy saving"	"Hepburn has excellent climatic conditions for solar. The total rooftop solar capacity in Hepburn is estimated to be nearly 6 MegaWatts (the equivalent of 1,250 large household systems of 4kW each), based on an available rooftop area of 82,000 sqm. Using all of this roof space could meet about 40% of Hepburn's total annual electricity demand."	"Should some form of community micro-grid or virtual power plant be possible in the future, medium scale storage options may be attractive to store and supply power locally. At a household level, storage enables high utilisation (e.g. 80-90%) of on-site solar generation with the grid being used as a back up during low generation periods (e.g. winter). Substations and power lines around the Hepburn Shire are not currently constrained and should be able to accommodate a reasonable increase in the solar PV across Hepburn. The introduction of battery storage on the low voltage side of the substation reduces the impact of high penetrations of solar PV and may avoid the need for punative solar export limiting or even refusal."	"Hepburn has a medium solar exposure and plenty of available land for utility scale solar. This availability of land - which account for land uses, elevations, and population data - is what will theortically limit the total solar farm capacity in the Hepburn Shire area. A single large scale 60MW solar farm (i.e. the size of the Gannawara solar farm in north west Victoria), would generate about 110 GWh per annum - enough to meet over 140% of the Shire's electricity demand."	"The total wind resource in the region is high. Accounting for appropriate land uses, elevations, and population data, the wind farm capacity in the Hepburn area has been estimated at 1,500MW. Hepburn lies on tablelands with a reasonable to good wind resource and predominantly grazing farmland that is suited for wind turbines. The wind is already being harvested by Hepburn Wind's two community-owned turbines at Leonards Hill, generating enough power for 2000 homes at around 11,000MWh per annum. Total capacity: 1,500MW Annual generation: 3,500 GWh This potential generation is far beyond Hepburn's needs!"	"Productive land in the Hepburn Shire is primarily pasture land for grazing. Crop stubble is minimal. Forestry activity and saw milling occur in neighbouring shires, but not within the Hepburn Shire. Fallen hardwood is available as resource in the area, but this is currently used for space heating (a high percentage of households use wood heating). The Shire's waste is a reasonable source of biogas. Council is developing a pilot project, with views to expand to a 65kW system which delivers 252 MWh of electricity into the grid per annum and a 257MWh heating load."	"Hepburn Shire doesn't have the natural resources for mid- large scale hydroelecric power (which is an economic source of renewable electricity generation). However Daylesford has a history with one of the oldest micro hydro stations being located at Lake Daylesford that operated early last century, powering lights and buildings around the iconic lake, generating around 12kW. Local groups are currently looking at how to preserve the site and potentially get it up and operating again. There could be other existing small sites located around the shire. A minimum drop of around 60cm for the pipe, stream or waterfall is necessary to be viable."	"PSH is an important technology for load balancing of the grid as more 'intermittent' renewable energy is added (such as solar and wind). Systems can be developed utilising lakes, reservoirs, disused mines, irrigation systems, sewerage systems and drinking water infrastructure. However economies of scale mean that currently only mid to large scale projects are generally viable, these can be coupled with solar and wind installations. A recent study looking for pairs of dams with an altitudinal difference of more than 250m identified 22,000 potential PSH sites in Australia. Although the list is not exhaustive, there were no viable sites identified in the Hepburn Shire."	"Community microgrids and VPPs help participants use distributed energy resources like solar and batteries more effectively. This ability to share resources improves the return on investment and penetration of renewables. In theory, VPPs (and microgrids) that are connected to the wider electricity network generate additional revenue by participating in energy markets and providing grid support. However at present, this technology is in its infancy. The business case for community microgrids and VPPs relies on participation (i.e combined size of DERs), and is enhanced in areas where the grid is 'constrained' and able to benefit from grid support services. At present, Hepburn's network has reasonable capacity, but grid reliability could be enhanced."	"Australia has been slow to embrace EVs - partly due to model availability, current premium costs and concerns about vehicle range and charging infrastructure - however EV sales are forecast to be over 50% of light vehicles sales within 20 years. Recent modelling suggests that the replacement of all internal combustion engines with battery EVs in Australia would increase total electricity demand by around 26%. For Hepburn, the electrification of transport is an opportunity to target around 50% of energy demand and 33% of total emissions."	"The electricity we purchase can be 100% renewable if every business, household and institution in Hepburn chose to purchase 100% GreenPower through their electricity retailer, or through a group purchase of renewable energy through the local electricity supply. If community members want their electricity to be generated within Hepburn or nearby to Hepburn rather than being sourced from a commercial renewable energy generator with a grid connection to Hepburn. Hepburn Wind has an electricity product available. Sourcing bottled biogas and sustainable wood would also contribute to Hepburn meeting the zero net energy target."	"CST requires direct solar beam radiation. And while the solar resource in Hepburn is very good, it is not as high as areas further north in Australia. This makes Hepburn a less attractive as a 'pilot' site for deploying CST, which would be emerging generation technology in Australia. Similar to mid-large scale solar PV and wind, the potential capacity for CST is only limited by suitable available land area - which is very good in Hepburn Shire. At present, operational CST plants around the world are sized between 50MW and 400 MW - the smallest of which would generate enough electricity to meet the Shire's current demand."
