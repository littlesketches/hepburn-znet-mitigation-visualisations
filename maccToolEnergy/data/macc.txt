<p>More about this option from the Clean Energy Regulator website: Beef cattle emit methane when digesting feed and nitrous oxide from their dung and urine. Emissions from a beef cattle herd are related to productivity, which is influenced by feed composition and herd management practices. When cattle have access to sufficient high quality feed, they have better survival and growth rates. Improving breeding practices and removing less productive animals can also help enhance herd performance. The results of these improvements include herds with lower average age and higher weight gain relative to age. Emissions are reduced because cattle produce emissions for fewer days, and fewer animals are required for a given level of output. A range of management practices can deliver these emissions reductions. Farmers can choose the management practices best suited to their circumstances. Types of practices that could be adopted include 1) establishing higher quality pasture, 2) providing a feed supplement all year round, 3) improving weaning percentage by culling unproductive cows, 4) installing fences to control herd movements and improve joining practices and 5) expanding watering points to allow cattle to graze more widely and make better use of available pasture.

The benefit received is expected to be $13.5 per t CO2-e (i.e. the most recent ACCU action price at the time of modeling). For convenience, actions are assumed to continue to 2029.</p>"	1									
Reduce Waste To Landfill	Municipal	Reducing waste emissions	Emissions Reduction	0	971	t CO2-e	0.30%	0	0	GJ	na	na	0	MWh	0.00%	"<p>Landfill waste - particularly of organic content - emits greenhouses gases as waste decomposes. This option provides a general opportunity assessment for reducing the amount of waste to landfill through a combination of actions to use/waste less, increase recycling rates and to compost organic materials on site. These are just a handful of the household and business-level behavioral change opportunities outlined into h Hepburn Shire' Waste Management and Resource Recovery Strategy (2014). Policy and strategic actions at the Council and Regional level - outlined in the Highlands Regional Waste Management Groups Regional Waste Management Plan - are assumed to be implemented to support the outcome of reduced landfill waste. It should be noted that reducing organic waste for collection will impact the amount of available feedstock for waste to energy projects: however this interaction is modeled here.</p>
<p>This model assumes a simple reduction of waste to landfill at the household level of 10% (for locals only), and a reduction of commercial and industrial waste to landfill of 20% (including visitor component of Commerical waste). To simplify the accounting of waste categories, municpal waste collected in public bins is included in the 'household' component i.e. in the same kerbside collection.</p>
<p>Although reducions from these actions are assumed to continue indefinitely, modelling is only extended to the ZNET timeframe (12 years). All actions are assumed to be linked to behvarioual changes and are modeled with $0 upfront cost.</p>"	1

Modeling in this option assumes that average vehicle mileage remains consistent over time (i.e. does not include behavior change and modal shift impacts). The option targets four types of vehicle types for a combination of replacement with smaller (i.e. 6cylinder to 4 cylinder and 8+ cylinder to 6 cylinder) and/or more efficient (newer) engines, based on Australian average fuel efficiencies for newer ('less than five years old') vehicles. Expected future vehicle efficiency improvements and fuel switching between ICE fuel types are not modeled.</p>
<p>Passenger vehicles (15337 in total) account for 50% of all transport emissions. Under this option, 13326 passenger vehicles are targeted, with 71% modeled to changeover, or 10930 vehicles in total.</p>
<p>The marginal cost for each 'new' vehicle owner is modeled as $0, as vehicles are expected to changeover at natural end of life. The expected lower cost of a smaller engine is not modeled. Drivers are expected to save around $130 per year on average (depending on option and fuel type).

Modeling in this option assumes that average vehicle mileage remains consistent over time (i.e. does not include behavior change and modal shift impacts). Opportunity modeling using Australian datasets (ABS, 2016) shows that newer model LCV and non-freight trucks have tended to be more efficient (around 5%) than older models, however the efficiency of heavy trucks (i.e. Rigid and Articulated) has on average not improved. Accordingly, while LCV/non-Freight efficiency is modeled as a natural turnover (with zero marginal cost), modeling of the changeover of Rigid and Articulated trucks to more efficient versions is assumed to have a marginal cost (i.e. a 'premium' model assumed to be 'more efficient'.</p>
<p>LCVs and trucks of all types (4424 in total) account for 50% of all transport emissions. Under this option, 2949 passenger vehicles are targeted, with 67% modeled to changeover, or 2949 vehicles in total.</p>

It firstly acknowledges that the predicted uptake in (full plug-in) electric vehicles is highly uncertain and contingent on policy decisions, the willingness of manufacturers, and the development charging infrastructure etc. However for the purpose of illustrating the potential impact of EVs on transport emissions and energy demand (particularly the increase in electricity demand in the Shire for charging), this option targets the 'owners case' for both passenger and LCVs - heavy trucks are not considered as EV-versions are in further in their infancy for these large trucks.</p>
<p>Passenger vehicles (10124 in total) account for 50% of all transport emissions, while Light Commercial Vehicles (3778 in total) account for roughly 26% of all transport emissions). Under this option, 5561 passenger and light commerical vehicles are targeted, with 40% modeled to changeover, or 3887 vehices in total.</p>
<p>The marginal cost for each 'new' vehicle owner is modeled as $30000, which represents a large premium for plug-in electric versions of similar vehicles, with changoever expected at natural end of life for current vehicles. Drivers are expected to save around $3988 on fuel costs per year and $1500 in annual servicing costs, but will incur additionnal electricity charging cost of about $854per year.

Resident Ride Share / Active Transport	Municipal	Local transport	Emissions Reduction	-532.4	2448	t CO2-e	0.80%	-38.8	2448	GJ	2.40%	na	0	MWh	0.00%	"<p>Ride sharing (e.g. car pooling) and choosing active transport modes (e.g. walking and cycling) are two simple ways to reduce the number of trips made using transport fuels, and therefore emissions generated. This option looks at how each of these options could reduce emissions from: a) Trips ""to and from work"" by Hepburn residents able to ride share/carpool, and b) 'Personal' (i.e. non-work related) short trips (under 5 kms) that could be shifted from car travel to active mode of either walking or cycling. Trip ""type"" data is taken from the ABS Motor Vehicle Survey (2016) for Victoria and from the ZNET Hepburn Survey (2018). </p>
<p>The target uptake of 'to and from work' rides sharing is a 20% reduction in trips. This 'target' is fairly conservative but is relfective of Hepburn's rural setting (i.e. more dispersed and smaller businesses).</p>
<p>The target uptake of active transport (44% of trips) is considered achiveable as it reflects the active transport proportion (of trips under 5km) of ZNET Hepburn survey participants, who are assumed to be 'model citizens' (i.e. most likely to favour active transport. A lower rate (10% of trips currently 'active') is assumed for the general population, with 95% of the population modeled to increase their active trips.</p>
<p>The marginal cost for each 'new' vehicle owner is modeled as $0, as vehicles are expected to changeover at natural end of life. The expected lower cost of a smaller engine is not modeled. Drivers are expected to save around $850 per year on average (depending on option and fuel type).
